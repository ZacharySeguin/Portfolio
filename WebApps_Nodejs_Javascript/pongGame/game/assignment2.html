    <p><Strong>Game Information: </Strong>This is a simple multiplayer pong game, it is meant to be played by 
    	two players, but multiple spectators <br> can watch the game.
    	After any players score, the game will freeze and wait for both players to click on
    	the screen again before <br>starting a new round. 
    	After a player reaches a score of 5, that player will be crowned as the winner, and the 
    	game will reset to <br> it's original player selection phase to be started again. Each time the ball hits a paddle, it increases in speed!
